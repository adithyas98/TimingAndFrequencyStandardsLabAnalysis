# TimingAndFrequencyStandardsLabAnalysis

In this lab note book I will be looking into the data collected in in the Atomic Time and Frequency Standards experiment. This experiment conducted two different tests to in order to see the accuracy of a crystal based clock and two Rubidium Atomic clocks DG535, PRS10, and FS725 respectively. The oscillations of these clocks were measured graphed on a Tektronix DP02014B Four-Channel Digital Phosphor Oscilloscope and a Keysight 53220A 355 MHz-100ps Universal Frequency Counter.
